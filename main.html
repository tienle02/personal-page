           <h5>Hi there!</h5>
           <h1>I'm Tien</h1>
           <p> 
            When it comes to coding, I'm like a beginner gardener in a digital meadow.
            As the stars twinkle, my coding efforts begin to bloom, though not always perfectly. 
            Each line of code is a delicate petal, some vibrant, some a bit 
            wilted, adding to my growing bouquet of solutions. As I tackle the mysteries of algorithms, 
            it's like bees learning to pollinate. Every piece of code I write is like planting a seed, 
            and while some may not flourish right away, I'm learning and nurturing each one, slowly 
            creating a meadow that will one day leave everyone in awe.
